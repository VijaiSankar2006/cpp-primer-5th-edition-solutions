1.**Types** tells us what data can be *stored* and the *operation* that can be performed      
2.**byte** the smallest chunk of addressable memory 8 - bits      
3.**word** the basic unit of storage, usually smaller no of bytes, either **4 or 8 bytes** , **16 or 32 bits**      
4.**Builtin types**
    -**Arithmetic types**                
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-**integral types** char, bool and integers       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-**floating types** floating point numbers        
>**int** short, int, long, long long       
>**floating point** float, double, long double       
>all these types except char can be *signed* or *unsigned*     
**char** char, signed, unsigned, most systems implent only *signed* and *unsigned* where as char is implentation defined
