map, is a associative container which is a collection of elements, where each element is a key-value pair.
    we access the element with key as index, when subscripted with key returns the value of the element 
    ex:- domain_names to web_addressess
    
set, is a associative container which is also a collection of elements but its key is its value.
    we can access the element with suscript operator, provides a quick search to find whether a key is present
    ex:- a set of qualified people
