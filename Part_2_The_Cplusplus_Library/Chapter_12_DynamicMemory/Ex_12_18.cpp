/**
 * unique_ptr cannot be copied or assigned to another unique_ptr, as they own the object. So in-case if we want to manage the
 * obect through another pointer, unique_ptr needs to realease the object it owns so that another pointer can be assigned to manage, basicaly
 * we are transferring ownership.
 *         But shared_ptr doesn't own the object it points, so it cannot give away the ownership and there might be another
 * shared_ptr sharing the object which might delete the object even if there is a relese member.
 *         So there is no relese member for shared_ptr
